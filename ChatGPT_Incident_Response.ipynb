This file does not contain any information about the file, but it is an attempt to download files that are not in a directory that is accessible by the user. If the malicious files are found, the files will be deleted. A malicious user can download the downloaded files by clicking on the download button. Once the downloads are complete, a user will see a message saying that the malware has been detected. When the infected file has downloaded, it will download a file called \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\Office.exe\".\n",

            "1. The D-Link Dxnet service was attacked on April 1, 2017. It was a DXnet attack that was carried out by a group of Daxxers. This attack was conducted by Dixxer.com, a company that is a part of a large Drexel University Drixx company. In this attack, Droxx was able to gain access to the network of servers that were being used by the attackers. As a result, the attack took place on the same day that the first Dexx server was compromised. On April 2, 2016, an unknown group attempted to take control of one of these servers. They attempted a denial of service attack on one server, but were unsuccessful. A second DEXX server that had been compromised was also compromised on that day. Both servers were successfully taken offline. At this time, there were no reports of any other Dxxx attacks. However, on May 1st, two DXXx servers, one belonging to a security firm and one to an individual, were compromised by an attack by unknown Dxxxx. These two servers are known to be vulnerable\n",
